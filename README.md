## Description

This repo is created as easy example to show how I understand DevOps philosophy.

When there are a new commit github actions make a new deployment of the web.

The destiny is an AWS S3 web bucket.

The domain is configured to be access through ClodFlare CDN.

Every new commit run a deployment https://github.com/roberto-asir/cv-devops/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yaml

The deployment run a shell script to update S3 objects objects corresponding to the web archives.

Then make the deploy in AWS S3 using Terraform.

Pipeline use semantic-version to generate releases of new versions when (only) some file of the web is updated or created.

## How to run it

Clone this repo.

To run it is necesary have configured an AWS account.

The way of authentication from GitHub is with repository secrets.
